## Hello (^.^)/
In this repository, you will find a little program which is made based on a meme. As a Mercy Main, it is really important to me that I can respond to my Genji sarcastically.

Overall, it is a very simple program designed to be used in situations where sarcasm is needed. I want to improve the program with a GUI and perhaps some other features.
