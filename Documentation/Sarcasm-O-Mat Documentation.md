__Version 1.0__  
In the current version, you can execute the program and write your text in the terminal. After pressing '__Enter__', the program will output your text in the terminal but in a sarcastic manner. Then you just need to copy your text.

## 2. Installation  

The easiest way is to navigate to the directory where you want to install the application and then use the command below to clone the repository:    

```bash
git clone https://github.com/D3li4/Sarcasm_O_Mat.git
```

## 3. Usage Guide
After you have installed the application, you can open the `App.java` file with your favorite editor.  
I used __Visual Studio Code__. Now it is really easy. Run the main program and you can input your text in the terminal.
